The <a> tag is used in HTML to define a hyperlink reference.
This is used to link one page to another page, though the
most important part of this tag is the href which tells
the user what the destination of that hyperlink is. If
it has no href tag, then this <a> tag is only a placeholder.
This hyperlink doesn't have to be text either! Its possible
to use an image, a sentence, etc. as a hyperlink to another
image / site / webpage, etc.

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an html webpage.
In this case it was used to embed a picture of Russ and Anthony.
This tag is technically a place holder for the referenced image
and does not directly insert into the image to the webpage. Another
cool feature is you can use style the image by specifing a
width and height.

The <p> tag in HTML indicates where there is a paragraph of text.
This is of course used to make simple paragraphs of text for a website,
but in order to style it (font, bold, size, etc.) CSS is needed. If
you don't use the <p> tag in your website, all the text is not 
divided and would be jumbled together. This makes the <p> tag
very important for organizing blocks of text and the webpage
as a whole.

The <tr> tag defines a row in a table. Usually works in tandem
with the table header tag and table cell tag to fill in values
like paragraphs, images, etc. This tag creates the "blocks" of rows
for the table, where you can later specify the columns
and or organize paragraphs etc. Similarily, with CSS you can
style how the rows span over the columns, width, height,
background color, etc.

The <td> tag defines a data cell in a table on the website.
These data cells are generic and can contain most any type of
data including pictures <img> and paragraphs <p> or even
another table! These data cells can also be height and width
adjusted to fit the appropaite content like paragraphs, images,
etc. This tag is also necessary for defining the number of
elements in the a table row.

The <b> tag is used to as an indicator to the webpage to bold
any text that follows after it and ends with a </b>. This is
helpful when needing to emphasize certain words / text
in a paragraph, table, or being used as a header. It can also
be used to style text. However, it must be noted
that in new HTML5, the <b> tag should only be used as a last
resort because headings and inline CSS can do the job much
better and more dynamically.

The <ul> tag is used to define an unorder list or bullet
poitns. To create bullet points in that list, its often used
with the <li> tag which is used to create a list item / bullet
in the list. This can then be used to bullet sentences / paragraphs
or words etc. These lists can also be styled and aren't limited
to a text. This could be a list of anything such as images, gifs,
color blocks, etc.
